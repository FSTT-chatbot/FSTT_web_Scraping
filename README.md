# FSTT Web Scraping Project

This repository contains code and data files related to web scraping activities conducted on the FSTT (Facult√© des Sciences et Techniques de Tanger) website. The project aims to extract and organize information from various sections of the FSTT website.

## Repository Structure

- `json_files`: This directory contains JSON files generated during the web scraping process.
- `FSTT_DATA.txt`: A text file containing scraped data from the FSTT website.
- `FSTT_Web_Scraping_Formation_part.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file containing code for scraping the "Formation" section of the FSTT website.
- `FSTT_Web_Scraping_presentation_part.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file containing code for scraping the "Presentation" section of the FSTT website.
- `FST_Scrap`: This directory contains CSV and JSON files with scraped data from different sections of the FSTT website, such as cycles, deust, commissions, and more.
- `scrapy.cfg`: A configuration file for the Scrapy web scraping framework (if used).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python, Jupyter Notebook, web scraping libraries).
3. Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook files (`FSTT_Web_Scraping_Formation_part.ipynb` or `FSTT_Web_Scraping_presentation_part.ipynb`) to explore the web scraping code.
4. Execute the code cells to perform web scraping on the desired sections of the FSTT website.
5. Analyze the scraped data stored in the respective files (`json_files`, `FSTT_DATA.txt`, or the files within the `FST_Scrap` directory).
